## A huge thank you to:
1. Pahimar for his Lets Mod Reboot series and getting me interested in making my own mod.
2. Bedrockminer for helpful code for tools and weapons.

## And a nicely sized thank you to:
1. HardcoreGamingMC for providing all the textures for the items and blocks and testing the mod.
2. GullWolf for testing the mod.
3. CamGaming69 for motivation through his 'charm'. (Checking java files. Because java).
